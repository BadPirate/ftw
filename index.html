					<h4>1. Information published on frostythewallet.com</h4>

	<p>We don't store your data.  We don't want anything to do with it.  Frosty the Wallet
	stores data on your phone, but it's encrypted with a password you choose, and stays on
  your phone, which you should have disconnected from the internet.  If confronted with operatives
  trained in torture we would happily divulge everything we know.  Which is nothing.  That's the point.</p>
